Some of them offer solutions more innovative than others. Unfortunately, there are also a lot of copy-paste cryptocurrency projects which have little to no inherent value.

These are the two most popular cryptocurrencies and Ethereum is even attempting to take Bitcoin&#8217;s place as top cryptocurrency. Comparing some aspects show the strengths and weaknesses of either asset. A few of these are network transaction fees and associated transaction throughput. Currently, Ethereum processes more transactions at lower fees than Bitcoin.

The developers are putting a strong focus on asynchronous smart contracts (ASCs). This is similar to Ethereum, but it appears EOS will be far more efficient. How does it all work? What benefits does it provide? Asynchronous Smart Contracts Explained Whenever someone talks about smart contracts, Ethereum is inevitably brought up. Ethereum is immensely popular because of their implementation of smart contracts. However EOS is approaching this differently with asynchronous smart contracts (ASCs).

While there are ample rewards available for the business owner when a new company succeeds, a large number of risks also exist. It can be very difficult to work out a financial plan and zero in on what everything is going to cost. As a result, many new business owners make some common financial startup mistakes at the very beginning of their new venture. These mistakes can be serious enough to bankrupt your company early on. This makes it critical to have

While there is some truth to those statements, those &#8220;culinary dishes&#8221; are mainly limited to China itself. However, one man in New York was effectively selling hot dogs containing real dog meat. Xi Ping Chow was arrested not too long ago. Hot Dogs Shouldn&#8217;t Contain Dog Meat The term &#8220;hot dog&#8221; may have gotten lost in translation for Xi Ping Chow. The Chinese immigrant allegedly made hot dogs containing actual dog meat. He used stray dogs in the area as a main source of ingredients for future hot

If You Disagree With a Fact, Discredit It as Opinion The Head of the Ministry's curriculum board, Alpaslan DurmuÅŸ, announced last Wednesday that Evolution will be removed from the biology books of 14 and 15 year old student in Turkey.

That is especially true for people living in San Francisco with the development of a strange story. The taxpayers of SF could soon pay close to $200,000 in damages to an immigrant who was reported to immigration authorities. Since this individual is not wanted for any crimes, it is a breach of the city&#8217;s Sanctuary City policy. Immigrant Settlement Case Makes Headlines San Francisco introduced a law in 2013 which prohibited law enforcement agencies from detaining people for immigration reasons. The only exception is if said person is wanted for a serious crime. In the case of Pedro

A lot of computers and entire systems were crippled by this malware over the course of only a few days. It now appears there is a WannaCry variant targeting the Android ecosystem. To our relief, the Chinese police officials have arrested the developers. This goes to show some countries take these issues far more seriously than others.

A lot of unbanked people do not have access to basic financial services. Bitcoin can fill that gap nicely, assuming service providers take the necessary steps to combat fraud and other nefarious activities. BTCJam is a popular Bitcoin lending platform, but its reputation has taken a few hits over the past few years. An Overview of BTCJam and its Problems The concept of the BTCJam platform first appeared in a post on Bitcointalk in September of 2012. At that time, Bitcoin was not even close to its current popularity. BTCJam

While not intended to be a vote among miners to decide the future of the Bitcoin network, <a target='_blank' href="https://ciphrex.com/">Ciphrex</a> CEO and <a target='_blank' href="https://bitcoincore.org">Bitcoin Core</a> contributor <a target='_blank' href="https://twitter.com/eric_lombrozo">Eric Lombrozo</a> pointed out that miners are now using the signaling process as leverage in the discussion over Bitcoin scaling.<br/></p><p>Lombrozo made the comments during a discussion with host Thomas Hunt and Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song on Hunt's <a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTCB5bRGQj0">Mad Bitcoins YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>"This whole signaling thing is a huge problem that I think created a very terrible narrative," said Lombrozo.</p><h4>What Is BIP 9?</h4><p><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki">BIP 9</a> is a method of rolling out <a target='_blank' href="https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/soft-fork">soft-fork</a> upgrades to Bitcoin. The short description of this process is that soft-forked changes will be enabled once 95 percent of miners have signaled to the network that they are ready for activation, using a trick called "version bits."</p><p>"It was an arbitrary system created by developers in order to coordinate smooth soft-fork transitions," said Lombrozo. "It was not designed to be a political system for voting on controversial issues ever - that was never the intention."</p><p>Lombrozo also noted that, in the past, soft forks have been deployed on Bitcoin without any special treatment for miners, and BIP 9 was supposed to solve some of the issues miners could face during the deployment of a soft fork.</p><p>"It was introduced for the courtesy of miners to be able to reduce their <a target='_blank' href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/5859/what-are-orphaned-and-stale-blocks">orphan rates</a> and reduce the probability that they're going to end up mining blocks that are actually invalid - that was the real motivation behind it," said Lombrozo.</p><p>According to Lombrozo, the goal is still to get nodes upgraded and enforce the rules of the soft fork; BIP 9 was simply a technique to coordinate with miners.</p><p>The Ciphrex CEO added that there was nothing like miner signaling in the original version of Bitcoin, and Satoshi Nakamoto never used miner signaling for the soft forks that he deployed on the network.</p><p>"It was a mechanism that was created way later," said Lombrozo. "And once this mechanism was created, it was abused and turned against the developers to try to extort stuff. And now it's being used against businesses to extort stuff from them."</p><h4>BIP 9 Does Not Work With Uncooperative Miners</h4><p>According to Lombrozo, BIP 9 would not have been used for <a target='_blank' href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/segregated-witness-part-how-a-clever-hack-could-significantly-increase-bitcoin-s-potential-1450553618/">Segregated Witness</a> (SegWit) if the contributors to Bitcoin Core knew then what they know now.</p><p>"If we considered that there had been this kind of, like, contentious or adversarial situation, then BIP 9 would not have been used," said Lombrozo. "We would not have used the signaling mechanism because it obviously does not work under those kinds of circumstances."</p><p>In Lombrozo's view, miners are now using the effective veto power that comes with the miner signaling process outlined in BIP 9 as leverage in the discussions around scaling Bitcoin. He also believes Bitcoin Core developers may deserve some of the blame for using BIP 9 in the first place.</p><p>"But at the same time, we only had the best of intentions at the moment," added Lombrozo. "We thought we'd gotten through all these disagreements and it seemed like the miners were for it and going to support it ...  Obviously, the adversarial case needs to be considered because it's just the nature of this network and the way that it works."</p><p>Lombrozo suggested that miners also used miner signaling as a sort of "propaganda" tool with Bitcoin Unlimited, even though there was no activation mechanism included in the code.</p><h4>Never Use BIP 9 Again?</h4><p>According to Lombrozo, miners now think they have some control over the protocol due to the use of the miner signaling process outlined in BIP 9.</p><p>"Miners started thinking, 'Hey, maybe we have control over the protocol because of this whole signaling thing,'" said Lombrozo during his discussion with Hunt and Song.</p><p>Lombrozo claimed that "we're never going to use BIP 9 to deploy anything almost for sure" if SegWit is not activated via the current BIP 9 deployment.</p><p>As an alternative, Bitcoin Core could turn to <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki">BIP 8</a>, which is a variation of BIP 9 from pseudonymous developer Shaolin Fry that eventually activates a soft-forking change whether miners have signaled for it or not. Miners can still activate the change before it is automatically locked-in on the network, but approval from miners is not required before that lock-in takes place.</p><p>Watch the full episode here:</p><p></p><div style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;" class="responsive-object">

The success of the project was achieved due to the uniqueness of the solution, favorably differing from other products of this segment. Focusing on a large number of players unfamiliar with the world of blockchain technology and crypto currency, the founders set a goal to expand the popularization of the platform among ordinary users.

Ten years ago e-currency was a curiosity &#8211; today it has become, for many, a necessity. However, anonymity remains the main difference between conventional cash and online currencies. It is a common misconception among users of cryptocurrencies that Bitcoin is anonymous. Bitcoin is actually pseudonymous, meaning that the user&#8217;s wallet number is an alias, a pseudonym. If the pseudonym&#8217;s association with the identity of the wallet&#8217;s owner is exposed, the entire history of the transactions involving this wallet will be compromised. BITPETITE

Once you convert your fiat currency to bitcoin, those funds are kept in a virtual wallet, and are assigned a private key. From this point, it is impossible to tell who owns the bitcoins, which protects the owner's identity. On the other hand, fiat currency can be traced through bank account and credit card details, so the authorities will always know where the money goes. By monitoring transactions back and forth, gambling regulators are able to monitor casino&#8217;s activities and impose necessary

http://bitnewz.net/news/article/Voorhees-Bitcoin-Will-Probably-Be-Replaced-If-Scaling-Resolution-Not-Found-This-Summer	 <img alt="LTB: Erik Voorhees on Epicenter" height="448" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/LTB_EPI_ss.width-800.jpg" width="800"> <br/> <div class="rich-text"><p>Bitcoin has always been seen as the king of the world of cryptocurrency due to its network effects and first-mover advantage, but <a target='_blank' href="https://shapeshift.io/">ShapeShift</a> CEO <a target='_blank' href="https://twitter.com/erikvoorhees">Erik Voorhees</a> thinks bitcoin could be replaced as the top dog if a scaling resolution is not found this summer. Voorhees shared this point of view on <a target='_blank' href="https://epicenter.tv/episode/190/">the most recent episode of Epicenter</a> with co-hosts <a target='_blank' href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/bfcrain">Brian Fabian Crain</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://twitter.com/seb2point0">Sébastien Couture</a>.<br/></p><p>The debate over scaling Bitcoin has been the main topic of conversation in the ecosystem for the past two years, but it appears that the network <a target='_blank' href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin-now-likely-get-segwit-august-1st-avoid-chain-split/">will get the long-awaited Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade by August 1st</a>.</p><p>During his appearance on Epicenter, Voorhees discussed his support for the <a target='_blank' href="https://segwit2x.github.io/">SegWit2x</a> proposal, his impression that many Bitcoin users aren't paying attention to the scaling debate and whether Bitcoin needs an improved system of governance.</p><h4>Is SegWit2x Bitcoin's Short-Term Scaling Solution?</h4><p>SegWit2x, which is <a target='_blank' href="https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin-scaling-agreement-at-consensus-2017-133521fe9a77">supported by a large number of Bitcoin companies and miners</a>, is a proposal for adding SegWit and a <a target='_blank' href="https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/hard-fork">hard-forking</a> increase to the block size limit to Bitcoin. Voorhees described himself as a "big proponent" of the proposal during his appearance on Epicenter, saying that it's the "only viable, actual option to moving Bitcoin forward."</p><p>"I want SegWit on Bitcoin as soon as possible," said Voorhees. "I also want a hard fork to a larger base block size as soon as possible, and SegWit2x hopefully will make those things happen."</p><p>Voorhees said that he is also bullish on the possible success of SegWit2x due to the declared support of the proposal from over 80 percent of the network hashrate.</p><p>According to Voorhees, the activation of SegWit2x will move Bitcoin out of a "trough of misery" that he believes the digital cash system has been in for the past two years, though he also believes the deployment of these changes has the potential to cause some volatility in the near term.</p><p>"This stagnation has been really horrible for Bitcoin," said Voorhees.</p><p>In Voorhees's view, the activation of SegWit2x on the Bitcoin network will lead to a rally in the bitcoin price that "will be unlike anything that people have ever seen before." He also believes the activation of the scaling proposal will allow everyone in the ecosystem to refocus on building on top of Bitcoin rather than debating over the base protocol.</p><p>At one point during his Epicenter interview, Voorhees admitted that he almost doesn't care which scaling proposal is activated on the network.</p><p>"I just want something to happen," said Voorhees. "If this summer fails to find some kind of resolution to this debate, then I'm pretty bearish on bitcoin, and I think it'll probably be replaced."</p><h4>Bitcoin's Userbase is Much Larger Than /r/Bitcoin</h4><p>Voorhees also discussed the Bitcoin community as a whole during his appearance on Epicenter, and he noted that Bitcoin's userbase is much larger than some may realize.</p><p>"The community is so much larger than Reddit, and people that live on Reddit don't realize this," said Voorhees.</p><p>While the /r/Bitcoin subreddit is still a main hub of the community, Voorhees pointed out that both <a target='_blank' href="https://blockchain.com">Blockchain</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> have 10 million users each. By comparison, /r/Bitcoin has roughly 250,000 subscribers.</p><p>Voorhees then told a story of going to a recent Bitcoin meetup in Berlin, Germany, where Blockchain CEO Peter Smith asked the audience how many of them had heard of the SegWit2x proposal. According to Voorhees, about 5 percent of the crowd raised their hands.</p><h4>Does Bitcoin Need a Better System of Governance?</h4><p>Voorhees's story about the Berlin meetup eventually turned into a broader conversation of how changes should be made to the Bitcoin protocol. Crain pointed out that some of the newer altcoins coming onto the market, such as Tezos, are heavily focused on the issue of network governance.</p><p>"It's a slippery slope," said Voorhees. "When you start having structured governance, you start moving toward an organization that can be compromised. As difficult as Bitcoin has been in making progress on this one debate, it also is showing immense resilience to change, which is good and bad - it depends what the issue at hand is. You have to be careful if you want something like a blockchain project to turn into a more traditional-looking organization with a hierarchical structure and certain people who make key decisions. That's not necessarily the best way that a blockchain should exist."</p><p>Voorhees then admitted that he does not know the best governance model for a blockchain, but he thinks it's great that there is so much experimentation taking place in this area right now.</p><p>Watch the whole episode here:</p><p></p><div style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;" class="responsive-object">

Ransomware, malware, ad phishing schemes are thriving. It now appears a new darknet email spam service will stop harassing users if they pay a small Bitcoin fee. This is an interesting model, but its success remains to be seen. Paying Criminals to Stop Spamming Most consumers around the world have dealt with email spam campaigns before. Very few consumers know how their email addresses got into the hands of a spammer. Spam emails are a lucrative business and they are now a primary

Earlier this week, most of the cryptocurrencies suffered from a major downturn. Luck has turned in favor of the patient holders, as nearly all currencies in the top 20 have turned green again. Not all of the top currencies and assets recorded equal gains as we will explain below. The Cryptocurrency Markets Cannot be Kept Down Forever It is not uncommon for cryptocurrency markets to see highs and lows in the same week. Even though Bitcoin volatility has become less of a factor over the past

Although we are not financial or trading advisers, the simple answer is how there is never a bad time to buy Bitcoin. The best opportunity was yesterday, but the second-best option is today. Interested parties always need to keep in mind they should never invest more money than they can afford to lose. There is Never a Bad Time to Buy Bitcoin Everyone would love to buy bitcoin at the cheapest price possible. Preferably at the price of $0.01 per BTC

Worryingly, this does not appear to be the case for many banks. A new report by Online Trust Alliance paints a troubling picture. They claim nearly seven of every ten US banks failed web security testing. Such a high number is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age of theft and data breaches.

http://bitnewz.net/news/article/Get-Your-Wages-in-Cryptocurrencies-Bitwage-Expands-to-the-UK	 <img alt="Get Your Wages in Cryptocurrencies: Bitwage Expands to the U.K." height="448" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/bitwageUK.width-800.jpg" width="800"> <br/> <div class="rich-text"><p>It's getting easier all the time to be paid in cryptocurrency. As of Monday, July 3, Bitwage, the Bitcoin payroll and international wage payment service, <a target='_blank' href="https://blog.bitwage.com/2017/07/03/bitwage-launches-united-kingdom-services/">announced</a> that it is launching services in the U.K. While there might be irony given that earlier this year Bitwage also announced it would offer European Union (EU) IBAN numbers to workers anywhere in the world receiving wages from EU companies, the latest news suggests that the United Kingdom is ready for cryptocurrency. But Bitwage has been <a target='_blank' href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitwage-introduces-bitwage-cloud-savings-implements-bitreserve-connect-1436302724/">saying</a> that for two years.<br/></p><p>"For domestic workers, we are providing the easiest way for users to obtain digital currencies," Jonathan Chester, founder and president of Bitwage, told Bitcoin Magazine in a recent interview. "It is just 'set it and forget it,' as your savings of bitcoin, ether or litecoin increase over time. This is great timing to allow all the new U.K. users that have come into the ecosystem due to the recent price rise." </p><h4>The Brexit Impact</h4><p>"For international workers, this comes at a good time during the uncertainty of Brexit," said Chester. "Once the U.K. leaves the EU, it will be much harder to receive payments from U.K. companies throughout Europe. Our solution will help reduce the cost and delays for workers receiving wages from the U.K., despite the impending consequences of the U.K. leaving the EU." </p><p>If Brexit leads to a significant change in the exchange rate, businesses will need to account for the most efficient payment process possible to reduce the likelihood of errors, delays or any other costs within their control. </p><h4>Adoption in the Workplace</h4><p>While entire companies can easily switch their entire workforce payroll onto Bitwage, this scenario is not entirely necessary. Individual employees can create accounts for themselves. "If someone is interested in getting their wages or a portion [of them] in cryptocurrency, all they have to do is sign up to Bitwage and provide the bank account provided to their employer," explained Chester. "[Employers] don't even need to know the difference." </p><p>However, a great way to spread cryptocurrency adoption in the workplace would be to discuss the advantages of Bitcoin with fellow employees and management. As Chester put it, "Bitcoin is a much better store of value than gold [because it's] easier to use and store, and it's much more scarce. For employees, taking a portion of wages in cryptocurrency would be an investment." Because users have the option of allocating the portion of their wages that are paid out in crypto versus fiat, it is an easy way to automatically start holding small amounts of cryptocurrencies. </p><h5>1.  Cryptocurrency Lowers International Payment Costs</h5><p>"If you are paying a lot of workers, it is about saving money on wire fees and not being limited on the amount you can send," said Chester. "Systems that save you money on wire fees, but do not leverage blockchain [technology], have to use a method called 'float.' This essentially means they are holding money in the other country to pay out when they receive the funds and then send a bulk wire to replenish the accounts in the payout country later. These systems have to limit the amount you can send so that they do not run out of funds to pay out. This is not the case with blockchain [technology]."</p><p>Chester said that, before announcing its U.K. launch, several U.K. companies had approached Bitwage, hoping to use their service to pay workers in the Philippines. They wanted a way to save money on wire fees, save their workers money on exchange rates and remove limits on the amount of money that can be sent.</p><h5>2. Optionality Is a Powerful Marketing and Recruiting Tool</h5><p>For many people, particularly millennials, having options can be a legitimate benefit. Offering employees more options for how they want their wages paid out is empowering. Furthermore, it signifies trust between employee and employer. </p><p>Bitwage can also receive and pay out in a wide range of other currencies such as gold, silver, USD, Euros, GBP, BRL, PHP, INR, MXN, ARS, VND, NGN and UAH. Choice of currency could be a formidable recruiting tool to attract a much wider pool of talent. For instance, international employees, the unbanked, gold bugs, silverites and of course the crypto community might appreciate the option of getting paid in the currency of their choice. </p><p>Chester pointed out that once more than 50 percent of employees at a business are getting paid in cryptocurrency, an employer might even decide to provide an incentive package "like a bitcoin 401k."  </p><p>It is important to note, however, that once businesses receive bitcoins from a Bitcoin transaction, it becomes that entity's responsibility to report capital gains. If a business receives all of their transactions in another designated currency, no additional reporting is required. Before making these choices on the type of payment, payment processor and preferred currency for Bitcoin transactions, and before making any changes to their settlement, it's a good idea for business owners to discuss their intentions and their options with their accountants.</p><p>Furthermore, employees should pay careful attention the Bitwage's fee structures, since there are some <a target='_blank' href="https://www.bitwage.com/rates#historicaltickers">costs associated with the service</a>.</p></div><p>The post <a target='_blank' rel="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/get-your-wages-cryptocurrencies-bitwage-expands-uk/">Get Your Wages in Cryptocurrencies: Bitwage Expands to the U.K.</a> appeared first on <a target='_blank' rel="nofollow" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com">Bitcoin Magazine</a>.</p>

The Bitcoin Core development team's transaction malleability fix, Segregated Witness (Segwit), has been the preferred method of scaling by the industry. Even the mining community seems to agree to a conditional activation of Segwit. One condition requested by the miners is the execution of a 2MB hard fork, as explained in the proposed New York Agreement drafted by 57 companies led by Digital Currency Group that represent more than 80 percent of global bitcoin

Currently, the cryptocurrency and bitcoin communities are anticipating increased regulation, legalization and most importantly, trading activity in Asia. Earlier this week, the Japanese government officially removed the 8 percent consumption tax on bitcoin trading and purchases and the South Korean government announced its plan and intention to legalize the bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets during 2017. Other regions such as India, which long remained an unregulated but a potent market, is also expecting to receive practical

At the time of this article, the market is rejecting the neckline of the previous Double Bottom Reversal (shown in yellow and noted at the 61% retracement values) and has moved on to retest the 50% retracement: </p><p><img alt="ETHUSD Fib Retracement.png" height="320" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NB0GuYvu41MoCrw5zk-2k5LK7Fj9-jQ_tjasD_mpjJDzy8I6O1J2Q9fdRk2jUFOBDEMG5MjvvYX9C0TG8CqYYQkXKIimSjQ03KgjT46pgzH4AJxH9d-a4vYcW8lmGsK2U1Bq30ZK" width="624"/></p><p><i>Figure 2: ETH-USD, 1HR Candles, GDAX, Fibonacci Retracement Values</i></p><p>Multiple tests of the 50% and 61% values are very common in both downward and upward trends and can sometimes provide great opportunities for short-term market trades due to the predictable support and resistance values. Today's rejection of the 61% line is not entirely surprising; a lot of volume entered the market upon the arrival of the Double Bottom Reversal from last week, marking a potential turnaround from a strong bear market to a short-lived bull market. Ultimately, after failing to retrace the downtrend of the previous bear market, the bullish trend subsided and continued its way toward lower values.</p><p>In the coming days, don't expect to see any strong upward movement from ETH-USD markets without a test of lower values. As we continue to test the Fibonacci Retracement values, we can expect to see some turbulence surrounding another test of the 50% and ultimately a test of the 61% values. If we manage to slide below the 61% line, there isn't much in terms of support before the market reaches the lower $200s. A drop below the 61% line could lead to another slip of $50 as the market will ultimately try to find its next line of support.</p><h4>Summary:</h4><ol><li><p>The ETH-USD price has seen a slow descending trend as multiple tests of the established Fibonacci Retracement values have continued.</p></li><li><p>If ETH-USD drops below the 61% Fibonacci Retracement values, a pullback to the $200s is most likely - this is a significant level of support below the $250s.</p></li></ol><p><i>Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

It all comes down to having good internet, cheap electricity, and a colder climate to keep hardware cool. In the hopes of maximizing profits, we see some very unusual mining operations pop up now and then. Few think to mine Bitcoin in a desert, but apparently it can work. Desert Mining and Solar Power is a Lucrative Mix Not everyone has the tools or money to mine in the desert right now, but some are in a better position to do so.

http://bitnewz.net/news/article/Op-Ed-Initial-Coin-Offering-Risk-Factors-More-Than-Just-Legalese	 <img alt="Initial Coin Offering Risk Factors: More Than Just Legalese" height="448" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/legalese-gp.width-800.jpg" width="800"> <br/> <div class="rich-text"><p>Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are where cryptographic computing and federal securities laws collide. As investors lacking the technical expertise of early market entrants throw their money into cryptocurrency presales, regulatory agencies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cannot be expected to sit on the sidelines much longer.<br/></p><p>Even if regulators do not act, when a presale results in nothing more than profits for its promoter, a disgruntled investor will inevitably make a private securities fraud claim to try and claw back some of their capital; assuming a court will determine a presale of digital tokens to be a private placement of securities, any such federal claim would fall under <a target='_blank' href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/240.10b-5">Rule 10b-5</a>.</p><p>However, without conceding the point as to whether digital assets are securities (enough ink has already been spilled on the <a target='_blank' href="http://www.legalandcompliance.com/securities-resources/securities-glossary/howey-test-to-determine-if-an-investment-is-a-security/">Howey test)</a>, white papers are evolving into documents resembling private placement memoranda typical in a standard <a target='_blank' href="https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-rule506htm.html">Rule 506 private offering of securities</a>. Additionally, a presale purchase agreement is starting to mirror a standard securities purchase agreement. These hybrid documents represent a hedge against current conventional wisdom that digital tokens are not securities.</p><h4>Disclosure Is Key</h4><p>Rather than pulling a set of standard securities offering risk factors and slapping them onto the back of its white paper (increasingly, risk factors are being attached as an exhibit to the technical document), some consensus appears to be emerging among practitioners regarding cryptocurrency risk factors that should be disclosed, including:</p><ul><li><p>Regulatory risk associated with an undeveloped and emerging body of law both in the United States and internationally;</p></li><li><p>Unexpected transfer restrictions resulting from new regulations;</p></li><li><p>Uncertain tax consequences relating to an investment in digital assets;</p></li><li><p>No guarantee that any digital token will be tradeable on any exchange;</p></li><li><p>Illiquidity and volatility of any cryptocurrency;</p></li><li><p>Potential loss of digital currencies and wallet risks;</p></li><li><p>Malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of Bitcoin or Ethereum protocol;</p></li><li><p>51 percent attack risk with any new cryptocurrency; and</p></li><li><p>Failure to properly incentivize miners.</p></li></ul><p>Also, any developer contemplating a presale should take pains to disclose the material risk that the digital token will never make it to an initial coin offering.</p><p>While not a blanket defense, a robust recitation of the risks associated with an investment in an ICO could be an important tool in blunting a Rule 10b-5 claim or similar action under associated state securities laws, as it may, among other things, short-circuit the required scienter (i.e., bad intent) element.  </p><p>Generally, claims of fraud and misrepresentation are made only after an investment does not perform and are frequently viewed through the lens of "20-20 hindsight." Including risk factors and other cautionary language in ICO materials can play an important role in staving off liability under the judicial "bespeaks caution" doctrine, by warning potential investors about what could go wrong or cause an investment not to perform as anticipated.</p><h4>Caveat Emptor: Some Things to Look For</h4><p>Counterintuitively, investors should appreciate - and maybe even ascribe value to - seeing risk factors. Risk factors can serve as a "canary in a coal mine" for investors, in a positive sense. Their presence most likely means that a legal team has reviewed the ICO and provided legal diligence and feedback. </p><p>On the other hand, potential investors should be very concerned if risk factors are not customized for the ICO. In that case, an investor may wonder whether the ICO simply cut and pasted the risk factors for another project. If so, that could be a red flag that the ICO did not get a legal review, or that the counsel reviewing it is unsophisticated with respect to ICOs. </p><p>Until more clarity emerges around the seminal question of whether digital currencies are securities, expect a continuing creep of legalese into the formally technical documents used in ICOs. It is incumbent on all participants in the process to perform due diligence and understand all risks in order to protect themselves.</p><p><i>This article is a guest post by <a target='_blank' href="http://www.frostbrowntodd.com/professionals-j-gray-sasser.html">Gray Sasser</a> and <a target='_blank' href="http://www.frostbrowntodd.com/professionals-joshua-rosenblatt.html">Josh Rosenblatt</a>.

The only question right now is how different teams of developers plan to accomplish this. There are different camps trying to make this happen, either through a soft or a hard fork. One of the latest proposals trying to push for a Bitcoin hard fork goes by the name of Bitcoin ABC. It is an interesting proposal, which suggests an adjustable blocksize cap.

http://bitnewz.net/news/article/Meeting-the-Russians-Who-Hope-to-Strike-It-Rich-on-ICOs	 <img alt="These Are the Russians That Hope to Strike it Rich on ICOs" height="448" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/RussiaMeetup_0P45qm8.width-800.jpg" width="800"> <br/> <div class="rich-text"><p>"7...  00...  9...  0...   183." I type in the secret code as printed on the flyer that I found at the <a target='_blank' href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/russias-crypto-winter-shows-signs-thaw-saint-petersburg/">Blockchain &amp; Bitcoin Conference in Saint Petersburg</a> the day prior. But to no avail. The steel gate to the inner-city courtyard won't open, and the buttons I'm pressing seem like some kind of doorbell system rather than a lock anyway.<br/></p><p>As I'm about to give it a second try - against my better judgement - two more guys show up. They want to enter too and apparently actually know how to do it. Pressing the right buttons, one of them unlocks the gate and lets me in as well. "Are you going to the Crypto Friends ICO Meetup?" I ask. The guys nod.</p><p>I try some small talk as we move our way into the courtyard.</p><p>"So, what brings you guys here. Are you investing in ICOs?"</p><p>One of them answers. His Russian accent is thick, but his English is good. He says he actually works at a company that helps businesses set up ICOs. His job is to get the message out about a new ICO, as far and wide as possible via forums, chat groups, news sites, whatever it takes. PR, basically.</p><p>"The return on investment in these ICOs is insane," he enthuses. "Put in $10,000, and you can end up a millionaire."</p><p>The two lead me around a corner to an inconspicuous door with another lock. Here they type in the code on the flyer: <i>70090183</i>. The door opens, and we step into a small, somber hallway. A doorman sort of guy is sitting in an even smaller room to the left of us. He doesn't look up. An elevator waits on the opposite side of the hall. We get in, and one of my companions presses the button with a five on it. It takes us to the top floor.</p><p>"Have you heard of EOS?" the other guy now asks me. I have but don't know much about it. I tell him I know that the founder is supposed to be controversial; but I don't know the details. </p><p>"I think it could be the next big thing," he tells me. I nod, noncommittally. I don't usually put money in these things.</p><p>On the top floor is another hallway. I notice that the green rubber floor is covered with arrow-shaped stickers. "<i>Crypto friends meetup,</i>" they read. Seems like we made it to the right place indeed. The stickers bring us to the next door. One of the guys knocks, the door opens.</p><p>A bit to my surprise, we now step into a luxurious restaurant. The light-filled rooms with big windows are decorated with antique furniture, and large framed paintings hang on the walls. The restaurant itself is relatively empty, but people have gathered in a bar area in the corner.</p><p><img class="richtext-image left" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/cryptofriends.width-500.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="cryptofriends.jpg"><br/></p><h4>The Deal With ICOs</h4><p>In case you are that one person who hasn't heard of the phenomenon yet: ICOs - short for Initial Coin Offerings - have been the crypto-rage for most of 2017. They are essentially tradable digital tokens, sold as some type of company stock, but issued on a blockchain. And without most of the legal guarantees that actual company stock provides - assuming these coins can even be considered company stock at all. Maybe they're more like gift vouchers...  or something. Often, no one really knows.</p><p>Either way, companies have been issuing these ICOs to raise funds for their venture. <a target='_blank' href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_funded_crowdfunding_projects">Lots of funds</a>. ICOs have become somewhat notorious for selling tens of millions of dollars worth of tokens within minutes, earning startups - often with little more than a whitepaper to show for themselves - valuations more appropriate for C-series funding rounds.</p><p>The phenomenon has been catching on in Russia as much as anywhere else. Some of the most successful ICO projects are being developed by Russians - although they are often officially based abroad to avoid legal trouble. MobileGo is one of them, the mobile gaming platform that raised over $50 million. Another is Waves, itself a platform for ICO tokens, which raised over $16 million. It's Waves, founded by Moscow-based Sasha Ivanov, that is sponsoring today's event.</p><h4>Crypto Friends</h4><p>Mild electronic music fills the bar area, and small groups of people - perhaps two dozen in total - stand scattered throughout, chatting. Most have a drink in their hands: beer, wine and, in particular, cocktails.</p><p>I take a seat at one of the two tables that seems reserved for the event. One other fellow is sitting at the table. He's wearing a hoodie and shorts, even though the Saint Petersburg summer is not all that warm. He has his laptop open, his eyes focused on the screen. He looks up after a couple of minutes, so I once again try to make some small talk. He tells me he works in fintech. "<i>Real</i> fintech," he emphasizes. He develops trading apps for investing.</p><p>"What we're seeing here is a mania," he says when I ask him about ICOs. "There is no underlying value in any of these projects. They better resemble multi-level marketing schemes than proper investments."</p><p>He's clearly not a fan. So I ask him why he showed up at all.</p><p>"Maybe in five months or so, it could develop into something useful," he says. "The concept has potential, but it needs to grow into something more serious. It could potentially be an interesting mix between crowdfunding and Initial Public Offerings. Eventually."</p><p>Another guy joins the table but doesn't sit down. He seems to be in his thirties, casually dressed as most people are: a landscape architect, he tells me when I ask him. "I invest but only a little. To make some money on the side," he says. "Mostly in mobile platforms or apps." His English is a bit shaky. As a friend of his shows up, he bids me goodbye.</p><p>I watch the two of them walk away, and it's only now that I realize that in the back of the bar area, hidden behind curtains next to the bar itself, is another doorway.</p><h4>The Actual Crypto Friends</h4><p>Probably at least a hundred people sit around on sofas throughout this next large, round room, filled with the fruity smoke odor of water pipes. The glass ceiling is covered with cloth to keep some of the light out, and Russian finger food is laid out on coffee tables. The walls around us are covered with paintings, books and even some handcrafted art.</p><p>Apparently the bar was just for drinks. This is where the actual meetup is. I take a seat on one of the sofas.</p><p>There's no stage. Instead, a guy with a neat, buttoned-up shirt is standing in the middle of the room with a microphone. He's giving what seems to be an elevator pitch. Within five minutes, the next speaker is up. And the next one some ten minutes after that.</p><p>The unofficial MC of the night has a spot on a comfortable chair in the middle of the room. Three others are sitting close him: a sort of literal inner circle. They lead the charge in asking questions after each talk. I don't understand any of it; it's all in Russian, of course.</p><p>During the smoke break - we're back in the courtyard - I walk up to the MC, and ask him if he's the organizer. He quickly turns me over to Daria, a dark-haired girl in her twenties. I had noticed her pacing around the meetup area during the talks. I learn that she has put together today's event.</p><p>"The speakers today cover just about anything there is to know about ICOs," she explains, when I ask her what the purpose of the meetup is. "The potential, the risks, the legal aspect of it."</p><p>"So why are people here?" I try. "What do you think, if you're being honest? Is it just to make a quick buck?"</p><p>"It differs," she says. "The crowd is diverse. We've got programmers, professional investors, hobbyists and more."</p><p>Though, she clearly agrees that at least some people are here just to make some easy money.</p><p>"Sure, some projects are more valid than others. And yes, there's lots of hype. But it's a bit like the early days of Kickstarter. Over time the hype will calm down, and this method of fundraising will prove valuable."</p><h4>Anton</h4><p>As the smoke break ends, Daria and the others head back to the big round room. I decide to stick to the bar area this time. At least in there I can chat a bit.</p><p>Having bought a beer for some $7- surprisingly expensive by Russian standards - I'm killing some time on my phone when a blond man joins me at the bar. His name is Anton. He has a British accent, picked up from his studies in the U.K., he says.</p><p>"I see this as Russia's chance to take on a leadership role in the technology sector. We've been trailing the U.S. and Europe too much," he tells me, after I ask him my by-now standard question: <i>Why are you here?</i></p><p>Anton is very clearly speaking from a place of passion. He stands close to me, speaking a bit too loudly. He believes in what he says.</p><p>"But we're not just here to make money, man," he emphasizes after I tell him I work for <i>Bitcoin Magazine</i>. "I don't want you to see it like that. Blockchains are about much more than that. We're here to transform society. And that's important to remember."</p><p>Anton tells me about the potential of blockchains. The typical buzzwords. <i>Transparent. Immutable. Censorship resistant.</i></p><p>I feel almost nostalgic, listening to the way Anton explains himself. I remember a similar vibe from back in 2013, when I visited my first Bitcoin meetups. The air was filled with excitement. Andreas Antonopoulos' talks were going viral for the first time. Bitcoin was gonna change the world in every imaginable way.</p><p>"Blockchain technology has the potential to make an end to corruption," Anton says. "It can make votes impossible to forge, for example." He says he believes the Russian political system has been rigged for decades. "Now, we can have provably fair elections."</p><p>It makes me slightly uneasy to watch Anton's enthusiasm, with the ICO bubble that I've witnessed being built up.</p><h4>The Bubble...  and the Potential</h4><p>And it is a <a target='_blank' href="http://www.coindesk.com/icos-dumb-money-ethereums-ethical-dilemma/">bubble</a>. The valuation of many of these projects is far beyond reason, and the evidence that many of the investors have no idea what they're putting money into is abundant. And that's without even getting into some of the outright fraudulent claims.</p><p>In addition to that, the legal status of this whole concept is <a target='_blank' href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/attorney-pamela-morgan-explores-initial-coin-offerings-legal-perspective/">unclear</a>. There are <a target='_blank' href="https://hackernoon.com/dear-sec-icos-tokens-are-killing-innovation-2f8d287f88c3">good arguments</a> to be made that ICOs are really just unlicensed securities, specifically designed to skirt existing regulation. As such, regulators are bound to step in at some point - else they may as well close shop and find new careers. And when they do step in, it could mean that the ICO party is over very quickly.</p><p>At the same time, some of the genuine enthusiasm I encounter in Saint Petersburg makes me wonder if I've just grown cynical over the past couple of years. The cryptocurrency and blockchain space has been exhausted by scams, failures and toxicity. It's had a bit of a disheartening effect on many, including myself. </p><p>But perhaps there's more to this phenomenon than just scams. Who knows? Maybe the ICO strategy can break down barriers, allowing the common man to access investment markets more easily. Perhaps projects can better raise funds without caring about international borders, restrictions and regulations.</p><p>Indeed, perhaps ICOs could at one point be a fruitful "mixture between Kickstarter and IPOs." If nothing else, the phenomenal valuations suggest that there may be untapped liquidity markets.</p><p>"In Russia we have the developers, we have good ideas, and we have the talent," as one of the meetup attendees tried to explain. "It's money, funding that's hard to come by. ICOs are a chance to realize that part of the puzzle."</p><p><i>Note: Some names have been changed to protect privacy and anonymity.</i></p><p><br/></p></div><p>The post <a target='_blank' rel="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/meeting-russians-who-hope-strike-it-rich-icos/">Meeting the Russians Who Hope to Strike It Rich on ICOs</a> appeared first on <a target='_blank' rel="nofollow" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com">Bitcoin Magazine</a>.</p>

The cybersecurity company has built a database updated with "10 to 15 million pages per day, from more than 24,000 domains on the Tor network alone, as well as other darknet networks." With the darknet content indexed and searchable in 47 different languages, OWL claims their dark web database is the "most comprehensive one of its kind in the world."</p><p>In the study, the OWL picked each and every company from the 2017 Fortune 500 list and assessed them with an overall darknet footprint. OWL uses a specific algorithm for the purpose, rating postings on the dark web based on their potential for criminal use.</p><p>"To compile our Darknet Index, we ran each member of the 2017 Fortune 500 through the OWL Vision database. We focused on specific darknets for matches on each company's website and email domains and then further adjusted the results based on computations of 'hackishness,'" the report reads.</p><p>When valuable information is either stolen or hacked, the data is often offered for sale on the dark web, OWL stated. On dark web marketplaces and forums, criminals exchange illegal products and data - mostly sourced from hacks and breaches - for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. Therefore, the cybersecurity company measured the exposure of the Fortune 500 firms by analyzing their presence on the darknet.</p><p>According to the researchers, in some instances, "private data for sale may have come from a breach at a Fortune 500 company, but it may not be identified as such." OWL explained, for example, that multiple instances of credit card information up for sale on the dark web can come from various sources, including banks or retailers; however, information on the source of the compromised data is not always available or provided.</p><p>OWL ranked the Fortune 500 companies by their Darknet Index score - calculated by the cybersecurity firm's algorithm - and also included the firms' rankings on the Fortune 500 lists. Ranked by DARKINT (darknet intelligence), technology companies lead the list, with Amazon holding the top spot, but with telecommunications firms right alongside it.</p><p>The cybersecurity firm pointed out some key takeaways from their analysis. The researchers emphasized that all Fortune 500 companies have a presence on the dark web since "every single company in the Fortune 500 had a positive Darknet Index score." OWL explained Amazon's top ranking with the fact that the firm has a "massive internet presence and possesses a significant amount of customer data." </p><p>The researchers were surprised by the comparatively positive rankings of financial firms, which are frequent targets of cybercriminals. OWL indicated that the financial industry's significant investment in cybersecurity measures in recent years was the reason for the success. Other sectors in which the firms invested "heavily" in cybersecurity also had lower Darknet Index ratings, the researchers added.</p><p>OWL expects that by publishing such statistics in their report, they can help companies improve their cybersecurity. The cybersecurity firm enables companies with compromised data to monitor the stolen or hacked information on the dark web.</p><p>"Today, in an age where data loss is virtually inevitable, it is critical to look at the darknet as a key part of a complete cybersecurity program, enabling organizations to swiftly detect security gaps and mitigate damage prior to the misuse of data."</p></div><p>The post <a target='_blank' rel="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/cyber-security-firm-reports-all-fortune-500-companies-exposed-dark-web/">Cybersecurity Firm Reports All Fortune 500 Companies Exposed on the Dark Web</a> appeared first on <a target='_blank' rel="nofollow" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com">Bitcoin Magazine</a>.</p>

It&#8217;s alleged that Google has been artificially and illegally promoting its own price comparison service in searches and thus has been denying customers opportunities of making genuine choices.

Sending funds to a wrong address can have very dire consequences. Thankfully, it is virtually impossible to send Bitcoin to a wrong block chain.

Cross-blockchain Bitcoin Transactions Are Incredibly Rare One of the main reasons why sending Bitcoin to a wrong blockchain is practically impossible is due to all wallet clients implementing a checksum

Ants, for example, are one of the most ingenious species on the planet. Researchers have been baffled by how these insects find their way back to the nest and how this can be replicated. It appears using a tiny treadmill for ants solved a large part of the mystery. Tiny Treadmill Results in Great Understanding For those people who are unaware, ants often find their way back to the nest by using the sun as a navigational tool.

The exchange was used to launder more than $10 million worth of funds, authorities reported.<br/></p><p>Both Murgio and Yuri Lebedev, 39, of St. John's, Florida, operated Coin.mx through a fraudulent company called "Collectables Club." <a target='_blank' href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/operator-unlawful-bitcoin-exchange-pleads-guilty-multimillion-dollar-money-laundering">According to</a> the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the illegal Bitcoin exchange used the firm's misleading name to open financial accounts at banks pretending to be a "members-only association of individuals who discussed, bought, and sold collectible items and memorabilia." Murgio and Lebedev, along with other co-conspirators, violated bank and credit card company rules and regulations by "deliberately misidentifying and miscoding Coin.mx customers' credit and debit card transactions."</p><p>"Lies conceived and deployed by Murgio permeated every aspect of Coin.mx's operation, including its use of front companies, like Collectables Club and Currency Enthusiasts, to try to conceal the illicit nature of the operation," the Department of Justice stated in its <a target='_blank' href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/06/27/murgiosentencingsubmission.pdf">sentencing submission</a>.</p><p>On January 9, Murgio <a target='_blank' href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/operator-unlawful-bitcoin-exchange-pleads-guilty-multimillion-dollar-money-laundering">pled guilty</a> to three counts regarding operating Coin.mx, which processed over $10 million worth of illegal Bitcoin transactions. Murgio ran the Bitcoin exchange between October 2013 and July 2015 for Gery Shalon, 33, an Israeli citizen who was responsible for hacking at least nine companies, including JPMorgan Chase, E-Trade Financial Corporation and Dow Jones. Coin.mx sold bitcoins that came from illegal online transactions, such as victim payments to ransomware attackers who sought to launder the cryptocurrencies clean.</p><p>"I screwed up badly and made serious mistakes and misjudgments," Murgio said, showing remorse, to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan at his sentencing.</p><p>Shalon, along with Ziv Orenstein, 42, <a target='_blank' href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/israelis-in-jpmorgan-hack-case-to-be-extradited-to-us/">compromised data</a> on approximately 76 million household customers and 7 million businesses by hacking the nine companies. U.S. officials described their operation as a "diversified criminal conglomerate" responsible for the largest theft of valuable information from a U.S. bank. The compromised data included the names of customers, along with email addresses and phone numbers. Authorities collected evidence stating that Murgio exchanged cash for the bitcoins of Shalon's criminal gang. Israeli police arrested Shalon and Orenstein in July 2015, and they were extradited to the United States in June 2016. Both are facing serious charges, including aggravated identity theft, wire fraud and money laundering.</p><p>"Mr. Murgio led an effort based on ambition and greed," and constructed on a "pyramid of lies," Judge Nathan said during the sentencing hearing at the Manhattan federal court.</p><p>On March 17, a Manhattan jury found Lebedev and his co-conspirator Trevon Gross, 52, of New Jersey, <a target='_blank' href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-chairman-and-ceo-credit-union-and-operator-unlawful-bitcoin-exchange-found">guilty of charges</a> connected to a bribery scheme in an attempt to hide the illegal activities of Coin.mx from financial institutes and regulators. Both of the defendants are facing a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. Judge Nathan scheduled the sentencing hearing of Lebedev and Gross for July 20, 2017.</p><p>Murgio's father, Michael Murgio, 66, was also <a target='_blank' href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-mike-murgio-sentencing-20170127-story.html">involved</a> in the Coin.mx case. In October, the father plead guilty to "making a false statement to the National Credit Union Administration on behalf of his son." By making a plea deal, Michael Murgio managed to avoid additional charges in the case, including "conspiracy to make corrupt payments with intent to influence an officer of a financial institution and making corrupt payments."

http://bitnewz.net/news/article/How-a-Bitcoin-Whitehat-Hacker-Helped-the-FBI-Catch-a-Murderer	 <img alt="whitehat (1).jpg" height="448" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/whitehat_1.width-800.jpg" width="800"> <br/> <div class="rich-text"><p>An ethical hacker breached the database of a phony darknet website offering hitman services and leaked the data. The information from the data dump helped the FBI in their investigation of a man who murdered his wife.<br/></p><p>In November 2016, Stephen Carl Allwine, 47, of Cottage Grove, Minnesota, <a target='_blank' href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/02/06/man-tried-hire-hitman-darknet-kill-wife-got-scammed-arrested-instead/">killed his wife</a> in "one of the most bizarre cases ever seen," police officers reported. The husband tried to mask the murder as a suicide, including putting a 9 mm pistol next to Amy Allwine's elbow. However, detectives arriving on the scene identified the case as murder and collected evidence - mostly electronic devices, such as computers - belonging to Mr. Allwine. Later on, in January, investigators arrested and charged Mr. Allwine with second-degree murder based on the forensic evaluation of the confiscated electronic equipment.</p><p>In May 2016, a hacker called "bRpsd" breached the database of a controversial hitman service offered on a darknet website. The service, "Besa Mafia," <a target='_blank' href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg77bn/this-fake-hitman-site-is-the-most-elaborate-twisted-dark-web-scam-yet">offered a link</a> between customers and hitmen, who could register on the site anonymously. The price for a murder ranged between $5,000 and $200,000, but clients seeking to avoid fatalities could also hire a contractor to beat up a victim for $500 or set somebody's car on fire for $1,000.</p><p>The hacker uploaded the <a target='_blank' href="http://archive.is/PWsAA#selection-9.158-9.163">data dump</a> to a public internet website. The leaked files <a target='_blank' href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2016/05/besa-mafia-dark-web-hitman-for-hire-site-takes-a-hit/">contained user accounts</a>, email addresses, personal messages between the Besa Mafia admin and its customers, "hit" orders and a folder named "victims," providing additional information on the targets. </p><p>The breach highlighted the fake nature of the website, which operated only to collect money from the customers. <a target='_blank' href="https://pirate.london/besa-mafia-murder-for-hire-scam-exposed-following-hack-3e4d6bed3a33">Chris Monteiro</a>, an independent researcher who also hacked into the site, stated the owner or owners of Besa Mafia had made at least 50 bitcoins ($127,500 based on the current value of the cryptocurrency) from the scam operation.</p><p>According to a <a target='_blank' href="https://allthingsvice.com/2016/05/16/the-little-texas-hit-that-wasnt/">message</a> posted by a Besa Mafia administrator and uncovered in the dump, "[T]his website is to scam criminals of their money. We report them for 2 reasons: to stop murder, this is moral and right; to avoid being charged with conspiracy to murder or association to murder, if we get caught."</p><p>The leak of the Besa Mafia database helped the police investigating the murder of Mrs. Allwine. As the officers analyzed her husband's devices, they discovered the suspect had accessed the dark web as early as 2014. Furthermore, investigators identified the pseudonym Mr. Allwine used on the darknet, "dogdaygod," which was also linked to his email, "dogdaygod@hmamail.com," in some cases. Detectives found bitcoin addresses in the conversations between Besa Mafia and Mr. Allwine, which linked the husband directly to the "dogdaygod" pseudonym, providing authorities with necessary evidence for the case.</p><p>Eventually, law enforcement agents analyzed the data dump bRpsd leaked and discovered Mr. Allwine's email in the list. In addition, investigators found messages between the suspect and the Besa Mafia admin. According to a <a target='_blank' href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3386250/Allwine-Stephen-Carl.pdf">criminal complaint</a>, Mr. Allwine paid between $10,000 to $15,000 to the supposed hitman service to kill his wife. The complaint detailed how Mr. Allwine had decided to have the hitman shoot Mrs. Allwine at close range and burn down the house afterward. </p><p>However, once the funds were transferred, the Besa Mafia communicator told Mr. Allwine that "local police [have] stopped the hitman [from] driving a stolen vehicle and taken [him] to jail prior to the hit," thus rendering him unable to complete his "service." The <a target='_blank' href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3386250/Allwine-Stephen-Carl.pdf">complaint</a> cited Sergeant McAlister who reported that during that time, "no one was apprehended in Minnesota and western Wisconsin in a stolen vehicle and possession of a gun."</p><p>It is likely that the ethical hacker's data breach had an impact on Mr. Allwine's case; on March 24, 2017, the Washington County District Court charged him with <a target='_blank' href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/04/10/oregon-man-charged-first-degree-murder-orders-assassination-wife-dark-web/">first-degree murder</a>. In addition, officers have gathered more evidence in the case - a drug called scopolamine was discovered at 45 times higher than the recommended level in Mrs. Allwine's body. Investigators subsequently discovered that her husband had also ordered the substance on the dark web.</p></div><p>The post <a target='_blank' rel="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-bitcoin-whitehat-hacker-helped-fbi-catch-murderer/">How a Bitcoin Whitehat Hacker Helped the FBI Catch a Murderer</a> appeared first on <a target='_blank' rel="nofollow" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com">Bitcoin Magazine</a>.</p>

Unfortunately, money, power and influence over time have stifled today's media environment adversely impacting both content producers and consumers alike. </p><p>In an effort to democratize creative content, <a target='_blank' href="https://decent.ch/">DECENT</a> has officially launched its blockchain-based, global media distribution platform. The name is an acronym for Decentralized Network; Encrypted &amp; Secure; Content Distribution System; Elimination of 3rd Parties; New Way of Online Publishing; Timestamped Data Records.</p><p>Designed to bring more transparency and fairness to the media industry, DECENT allows artists to seamlessly distribute digital content for immediate payment and without hefty fees. Peer-to-peer in its orientation, consumers decide the merits of a certain piece of content posted through a <a target='_blank' href="https://www.yelp.com/sf">Yelp</a>-like community rating system. The content, however, cannot be censored or removed. </p><p>This blockchain initiative endeavors to disrupt the legacy world of media distribution by allowing artists more freedom and control over the ownership and distribution of their content, all without compromising on security. It represents a potential gamechanger for the massive global media and content distribution industry - one that's estimated to grow from $1.7 trillion in 2016 to<a target='_blank' href="https://www.einpresswire.com/article/355286420/media-global-market-worth-2-trillion-by-2019"> over $2 trillion</a> in 2019.</p><p>DECENT was founded in 2016 by two friends, Matej Michalko and Matej Boda, from Slovakia. It sprouted from a shared vision that blockchain technology could fuel a coordinated system of digital content publishing and sharing throughout the world. </p><p>Funding for DECENT was fueled by an ICO campaign last summer, which raised more than 5,881 BTC, at that time valued at $4.2 million USD. There were 4,300 ICO participants in total and no other key funding partners.</p><p>Michalko recounted the journey leading up to his own personal discovery of blockchain technology and its potential uses for the content distribution space. "I've been extensively involved in Bitcoin since 2011, even mining it from my own laptop at the beginning. I quickly realized that the innovative technology behind Bitcoin had the potential to change the modern world."</p><p>When Michalko started to delve further into blockchain technology, he found a seemingly endless list of use cases the new technology could support. "I became determined to use blockchain technology to create something revolutionary that would be beneficial for people on a global scale. A short time later ongoing discussions between myself and our future co-founder Matej Boda quickly led to DECENT being born." </p><p>He says that DECENT Network is a reaction to the issues that the majority of content producers face nowadays in the entertainment and media industry. "There is too much artificial complexity and too many barriers in the industry affecting both the access to market and income of the content owners." </p><p>DECENT'S digital model allows artists to distribute any form of content, including written, music, videos, ebooks and pictures. These distribution channels are free of third-party influence, meaning that artists can also manage their intellectual property rights and set their own pricing. </p><p>One of the innovative adaptations that distinguishes DECENT from other blockchain platforms is the network's reputation management system. This allows content creators who share their digital work on the platform to build a lifetime reputation, based on ratings from those who purchase content on the platform. DECENT Network also allows content creators to instantly receive payment when someone downloads their content, without any middleman interference.</p><p>Michalko believes that DECENT can break the trajectory in which a majority of power is concentrated in the hands of a few players controlling the industry. "Artists, filmmakers and writers lose control over their work and depend on the mercy of the 'big guys.' We designed DECENT Network to do away with all that and bring more transparency and fairness to the digital content industry."</p><p>DECENT estimates that writers, for example, lose a healthy 30-75 percent chunk of their earnings when publishing with Amazon. Similarly, musicians, through licensing agreements, lose around 30 percent when selling a track on iTunes. Blockchain technology therefore serves as a mechanism that helps writers and musicians keep more money, while connecting with their audiences directly.</p><p>Michalko says that artists will be paid for their downloaded content through DECENT's own cryptocurrency called "DCT," which will be launched together with DECENT Network. Other payment options, he says, will be available in the future. "Artists will no longer have to wait months before seeing a penny from their work. And at the time of launch, DECENT Network will be a completely free-of-charge service for artists." </p><p>Michalko hopes that by  2020, DECENT Network will have become the number one worldwide media sharing platform. "We hope to bring more transparency and fairness to the digital content industry for both creators and consumers. I hope that with our launch people will realize the advantage of DECENT Network over other content distribution platforms."</p></div><p>The post <a target='_blank' rel="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/decent-launches-global-media-distribution-platform/">Decent Launches Global Media Distribution Platform</a> appeared first on <a target='_blank' rel="nofollow" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com">Bitcoin Magazine</a>.</p>

In a turn of events, when BTC-USD made its test of the Head and Shoulders neckline, it actually responded in a market <i>reversal</i>.<br/></p><p><img alt="BTCUSD HS Rejection.png" height="327" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/x7peU2KxSPg__CfapPNpIFrChJRMwkMCzn_ZYi-qe6403mXIq0PX2cHcw-I4CRLwP5sVrV0F5aIJZ_wzxzO6bEjeBb8fUNJsyWN0r2CAZ2_QV9wMCd-T_KqnTW1Giz8cL9TRf7nw" width="624"/></p><p><i>Figure 1: BTC-USD, 6-hr Candles, GDAX, Head and Shoulders Rejection</i></p><p>Yesterday, the crypto market took a turn upward as the market leader made a Double Bottom Reversal pattern that sent a market-wide bear run into an immediate bull run. As the BTC-USD market made an attempt to test the boundaries of the lower prices of the bear run, volume began to pick up and sent us into a market reversal. How does one spot this pattern and where are we headed in the next few days? </p><p><img alt="BTCUSD Double Bottom.png" height="317" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tkz4FfSeSwAkUf0Pt1sDpQzwL9oVkvxvHP1Cfb7_vc8WbLKu5tU1LdUz6LBE6F6aW96i3fn8WfALaqnjpBpch9lZnpJygoU4AQoJ7fWWClJRYLF9RO-fUlj5RRPkRAdqFXOpY4pM" width="624"/></p><p><i>Figure 2: BTC-USD, 30-min. Candles, GDAX</i></p><p>Characteristics of a Double Bottom Reversal pattern include the following:</p><ol><li><p>A descending trendline within an established bear trend (shown in white)</p></li><li><p>An initial bottom that temporarily reverses before retesting the established low (basically forming a "W" pattern)</p></li><li><p>After a test of the previously established low, the test is rejected</p></li><ol><li><p>It is important to note that in order to confirm the reversal pattern, typically you want to see consistent increased volume at the lower values (shown in dark pink)</p></li></ol><li><p>After the low is rejected a second time, it continues upward and breaks the descending trendline established in step 1 (shown in yellow)</p></li><li><p>After breaking the descending trendline, the price then forms a "neckline" with the rest of the pattern (shown in light pink)</p></li><li><p>From there, to confirm the trend reversal, we would want to see a break of the neckline followed by a retest of the neckline (shown in light blue)</p></li></ol><p>All the above characteristics are very strong indicators of a complete bear market reversal into a bull market. As mentioned in the previous BTC-USD analysis, the bear run would continue the trend downward until significant volume picked up. In our case, the volume picked up very strongly and made a complete market reversal. Much like BTC-USD, this pattern is seen throughout several major players in the crypto market: ETH-USD, LTC-USD, ETH-BTC, etc.</p><p>It is unclear where the top of the bull run will lead us, but what is clear is that volume has dramatically picked up, indicating market interest in the higher prices. Until the volume begins to die down, the price will continue to push higher.</p><h5>Summary:</h5><ol><li><p>Head and Shoulders pattern was strongly rejected in the form of a Double Bottom Reversal</p></li><li><p>Bearish trend has ended in a strong bull trend</p></li></ol><p><i>T</i><i>rading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The Opportunity at Hand Taking advantage of unutilized areas of the market usually is a rather lucrative opportunity, and Bolenum sees this potential.

http://bitnewz.net/news/article/Russias-Crypto-Winter-Shows-Signs-of-a-Thaw-in-Saint-Petersburg	 <img alt="stpetersburg.jpg" height="448" src="https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/stpetersburg.width-800.jpg" width="800"> <br/> <div class="rich-text"><p>A mixed crowd of denim jeans and custom-tailored suits, typical for crypto-events, is standing across the vertical aisle of the the main conference area at the Blockchain &amp; Bitcoin Conference in Saint Petersburg, blocking the line of sight for those lucky enough to have snatched themselves a chair in the back. The hall, while spacious - high ceiling, tall arched windows partly covered with ASIC mining billboards - still isn't quite large enough to fit all interested visitors.<br/></p><p>The speaker on stage works for Alfa Bank, one of the biggest banks in Russia. The financial sector in the former Soviet block is taking as much interest in Bitcoin and, of course, blockchain technology as anywhere else is. Having skipped Russia's second-biggest city for the past two years,<a target='_blank' href="https://www.smileexpo.ru/en/"> Smile-Expo</a> re-introduced its<a target='_blank' href="https://spb.blockchainconf.world/en"> Eastern European conference tour</a> in Saint Petersburg last Thursday.</p><p>"The event had over 600 visitors, 25 exhibitors and some 20 speakers. Four of those work for Russia's largest financial institutions," event organizer Pavol Likhomanov told <i>Bitcoin Magazine</i>. "Entrepreneurs and finance professionals are increasingly taking this technology seriously. This is evident from the turnup here in Saint Petersburg; and we've seen year-over-year growth in interest at our Moscow event as well."</p><p>This interest is not necessarily self-evident. It was only in 2014 - indeed, around the time of the last Saint Petersburg conference - that Russia seemed to emerge as one of the most crypto-hostile nations on the globe. In an attempt to curb criminal activity, the Putin administration <a target='_blank' href="https://www.rt.com/business/187440-bitcoin-ban-russia-cryptocurrency/">introduced</a> draft legislation that would essentially ban any use of cryptocurrencies. Not much later, access to a number of Bitcoin websites, including<a target='_blank' href="http://bitcoin.org"> bitcoin.org</a>, was<a target='_blank' href="https://gigaom.com/2015/01/13/russia-blocks-bitcoin-websites-as-potential-ban-looms/"> blocked</a> in the country.</p><p>But so far, the proposed law has never actually been implemented.</p><p>"Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies still have no legal status in Russia," Artem Tolkachev told <i>Bitcoin Magazine</i>. The director of Deloitte Russia's legal services for technology projects was one of the headline speakers at the event, where the legal implications of blockchain technology represented a big chunk of the morning program. </p><p>"The central bank considers cryptocurrency like bitcoin a money surrogate, which is a progressive stance. But the Ministry of Finance is more conservative. They don't like anything they don't understand and cannot control," he said. "And Russian policymakers are not always very open-minded. They prefer to have their own internet ...  their own currency."</p><p>Needless to say, Bitcoin is not a great fit in such a worldview.</p><h4>The Thaw</h4><p>But the initial icy stance on digital currencies seems to be getting a bit less frosty these days.</p><p>It was only a couple of weeks ago that Russian president Vladimir Putin met Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin at the<a target='_blank' href="https://www.forumspb.com/"> International Economic Forum</a>, also held in Saint Petersburg. In the widely reported event, within the crypto-sphere at least, the president was<a target='_blank' href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/54677"> said</a> to have "supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners" - referring to Buterin's technology pitch. </p><p>The announcement has been interpreted as a sort of preliminary green light for Russian blockchain entrepreneurs and investors. While not quite an official endorsement from the Kremlin, let alone formal regulation, it's been a hopeful sign nonetheless.</p><p>But until it's official, Russian cryptocurrency users across the halls in the historic Vedensky Hotel, the site of last week's event, remain reserved.</p><p>"The Russian market is volatile," Timur, a former forex trader, told <i>Bitcoin Magazine</i><i>.</i> He offers a platform that allows Russian brokers to trade on behalf of their clients, Russian cryptocurrency speculators. Speaking from his exhibit stand in Saint Petersburg, he explained: "We never know for sure if what's accepted today will be legal tomorrow. Official policy could change at a whim."</p><p>That's why his company sets customers up with foreign bank accounts in Switzerland, or Lithuania, or maybe offshore. The coins themselves - bitcoin, litecoin, ether - never leave the exchange where they are traded. </p><p>And these exchanges are not in Russia either ...  at least not officially. Incorporating abroad is a typical strategy for Russians and their cryptocurrency startups.</p><h4>Mining</h4><p>It's not just traders and the finance sector that are taking an interest. Bitcoin mining is growing in Russia too. </p><p>This is perhaps most evident from the rise of mining pool <a target='_blank' href="http://www.bitclub.network/">BitClub Network</a> over the past months. While officially established outside of Russia, the team works from Kazan, a city to the east of Moscow. Already one of the biggest non-Chinese miners on the Bitcoin network, BitClub Network's founder - he's casually wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with an image of Putin - assured <i>Bitcoin Magazine</i> his will be a top-five pool by the end of the year. At least, that's what one of his employees translated into English, his smartphone showing videos of data centers full of humming ASIC miners.</p><p>Russian miners are now setting up data centers such as these in the east of Russia, Alex of mining service provider <a target='_blank' href="https://host.bitmainwarranty.com/index.html">MyRig</a> told <i>Bitcoin Magazine</i>. "The temperature in Irkoetsk, for example, is ideal for Bitcoin mining: it can be -40 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, electricity is cheap. There's a big raw material industry, but with the crisis, some factories are out of use. With energy to spare, miners are starting to fill that void."</p><p>MyRig, a rebranding of Bitmain Warranty (not to be confused with <a target='_blank' href="https://www.bitmain.com/">Bitmain</a>), is not the only mining business at the Saint Petersburg conference. The company is vying for attention with several competitors in one of the exhibition rooms. One of them sells entire containers full of equipment, not unlike BitFury's<a target='_blank' href="http://bitfury.com/products#container-datacenter"> mobile data centers</a>. Another is re-selling Antminers, the best-selling Bitmain machines.</p><p>"But to mine bitcoin in Russia at scale, you do still need to have the right connections," Alex continues. "If you don't know your way around local policymakers you risk being shut down." Though with the increase in profits that the mining sector has seen over the past half year or so, the "big dicks" are entering the space, Alex said. "The guys with lots of money - and lots of connections. I'd expect mining in Russia to continue to grow significantly over the next year."</p><p>And official regulation should be coming too, Deloitte's Tolkachev said. A draft bill for cryptocurrency should be<a target='_blank' href="http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-changes-its-mind-on-bitcoin-ban-2016-9?IR=T"> introduced</a> within a few months, and could be approved by early 2018. This could bring some much-desired regulatory clarity for Russians wanting to open cryptocurrency-related businesses and otherwise openly engage in the industry without needing to work around the existing legal structure.</p><p></p><p>That is, visitors in the Vedensky Hotel generally seemed to agree, unless Putin changes his mind.</p></div><p>The post <a target='_blank' rel="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/russias-crypto-winter-shows-signs-thaw-saint-petersburg/">Russia's Crypto-Winter Shows Signs of a Thaw in Saint Petersburg</a> appeared first on <a target='_blank' rel="nofollow" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com">Bitcoin Magazine</a>.</p>
