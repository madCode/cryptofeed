# cryptofeed
## What it is:
An aggregator of news around the blockchain/crypto currency space.

## Goals:
Get a collection of the things that are relevant to the long-term foundation of the space:
1. New crypto projects and platforms.
2. Technology updates to old projects and platforms
3. Mainstream adoption of blockchain technology
4. Explanations and tutorials
5. Medium to long-term financial analysis
And ignore the things that aren't:
1. Moon memes
2. Lambo memes
3. I would say all memes but apparently as a group we have the creative capacity for only those two memes.
4. Some random old man on a hill somewhere has decided to announce that he thinks X currency will be at Y number and the article doesn't say how he got to this number or what his accuracy has been in the past so frankly I'm not even sure why someone was paid to write this article.
5. Technical analysis of how this chart from 2 hours ago looks like the kind of ladle you'd give to Goodwill rather than use to serve soup.
