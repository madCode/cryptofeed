## Goals
1. To aggregate all interesting news about the crypto space from a engineering point of view:
    * New crypto projects and platforms
        * e.g. There's this new project called Sia that's meant to do distributed file storage!
    * Technology updates on old crypto projects and platforms
        * e.g. Ethereum now supports Lightening Networks!
    * Adoption of existing projects/platforms
        * e.g. Imogen Heap released a track via the bitcoin blockchain!
    * Explanations and tutorials
        * e.g. Here's how to make a online payment system that supports Monero!
        * e.g. Here's an explanation of SegWit!
2. To leave out the useless stuff:
    * Moon memes
    * Lambo memes
    * I would say all memes but apparently as a group we have the creative capacity for only those two memes.
    * Some random old man on a hill somewhere has decided to announce that he thinks X currency will be at Y number and the article doesn't say how he got to this number or what his accuracy has been in the past so frankly I'm not even sure why we're reading this article.
        * Sure maybe it has something to do with market sentiment?
        * Maybe I can do a separate aggregating part that just returns market sentiment as a number...
    * Most talk about crypto prices.
        * It tends to just be about the number the crypto is at.
        * And then a crude drawing of the kind of ladle you'd throw out before using at a dinner party.
        * If you want technical analysis, you don't want it from a slow-ass RSS feed.
        * Sometimes crypto prices are useful? And trade chatter is useful? Like the idea that the Aug 1 2017 deadline for Bitcoin might have drastic effects on all cryptos in the short term.
        * I will use my best judgement.
